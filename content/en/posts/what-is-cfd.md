Ever wondered whats behind the marvelous design of F1 racing cars? These cars are outstanding examples of aerodynamics.So how does an engineer experiments the fluid flow over a design without building a real model . Answer to this is CFD .
CFD stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics .
It uses computer simulations to visualize and analyze how fluids like air or water move and interact with objects.
CFD a valuable tool that allows engineers and scientists to predict how temperature, pressure, and velocity will behave in a design before building a physical prototype.
*CFD is to fluid dynamics what a calculator is to mathematics*
Fluids have always fascinated engineers, from the way they flow through rocket nozzles to the plasma of a candle. As an enthusiast of computational fluid dynamics we constantly explore the complex ways that physics and mathematics intersect.. Whether it's optimizing engine performance or unraveling the mysteries of bird flights,theres always something new to discover.

Chopping down a bigger problem into pieces has always been a human behaviour.And this is exactly how CFD works.It works by applying appropriate mathematical equations that describe the behavior of the fluid and solving them numerically using computational methods.
Using proper operating conditions,numerical methods and physics lead to an accurate CFD analysis.
