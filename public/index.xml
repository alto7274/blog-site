      <description>Ever wondered whats behind the marvelous design of F1 racing cars? These cars are outstanding examples of aerodynamics.So how does an engineer experiments the fluid flow over a design without building a real model . Answer to this is CFD . CFD stands for Computational Fluid Dynamics . It uses computer simulations to visualize and analyze how fluids like air or water move and interact with objects. CFD a valuable tool that allows engineers and scientists to predict how temperature, pressure, and velocity will behave in a design before building a physical prototype.</description>
